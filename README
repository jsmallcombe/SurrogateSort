   SurrogateSort PARSER VERSION 1.0

   Usage dependent on root classes (and subclasses)
   Tested using ROOT 6.28/06 

   All commands can be given either on the command line or by passing a command list file.
   Command list file is any plain text file named *.info
   The # mark at the start of a line comments out the line in an info file
   Command line inputs and info files can be combined.
   Info file can be nested 
   
   Usage: ./bin/SurrogateSort run.info
   Usage: ./bin/SurrogateSort files.info analysis37434.root gates.info


   Inputs :
	Input Data file -
		Inputs can be specified as a list exactly, with a wildcard, or with a wildcard and a list of run numbers (pattern substitution)
		To specifiy an input with wildcards double asterix (**) must be used :
      e.g. path/analysis**.root
		Combine with run numbers to get only specific runs but without having to specify the entire file name each time
      e.g. path/analysis**.root 455 456 457
		Any exactly specified .root which exists will be assumed to be an input (unless -o is used) hence, 
		you can make use of pattern subsitution on the command line to go beyond the limits of the program input processing.  
      e.g. ./bin/SurrogateSort $(echo analysis/analysis37434_*.root)
   
	Output file -
		The output filename can be specified exactly OR with a wildcade (single asterix *) IF run numbers are specified
		e.g. NewOutput.root
		e.g. OutputRuns*.root /Data/Runs**.root 455 456 457
		
		If the file exists, you must use the -o command before it to overwrite, otherwise it will be assumed to be an input

	Calibration file -
		Any *.cal file
		e.g. Calibration.cal

   Extra Options
      -ID specifies the next argument will be a root file containing a TCutG for ID gating, followed by an integer to be saved in parrallel to denote a type of index etc.
      e.g. -ID /gates/AlphaGate.root 3

      Any other command preceded by "-" will be taken as a generic named numeric input e.g.
      -Offset 2.43
